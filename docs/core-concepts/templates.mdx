Celo Composer uses a powerful template system to let you generate projects that are tailored to your specific needs. You can choose a base template and then layer on integrations like wallet providers and smart contract frameworks.

## Base Templates

You can select a base template using the `--template` flag during project creation.

  <Card title="Minipay" icon="phone">

## Wallet Providers

Choose a wallet provider to handle user authentication and transaction signing. Use the `--wallet-provider` flag.

  <Card title="Thirdweb" icon="cubes">

  <Card title="None" icon="x-circle">

## Smart Contract Frameworks

Celo Composer can set up a smart contract development environment for you. Use the `--contracts` flag.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Hardhat" icon="hardhat">
    The industry-standard framework for Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains.
    Comes with a pre-configured environment for Celo networks, including
    deployment scripts and tests.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Foundry" icon="anvil">
    A fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development
    written in Rust. Includes Forge, Cast, Anvil, and Chisel.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How it Works

When you run `celo-composer create`, the CLI uses Plop.js to dynamically generate the project files based on your selections. It copies the base template and then conditionally adds the files and configurations for your chosen integrations.

This approach ensures that your project only includes the code it needs, keeping it clean and optimized.
