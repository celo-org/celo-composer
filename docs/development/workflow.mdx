Celo Composer is designed to provide a smooth and efficient development experience. Here’s a look at a typical workflow when building your dApp.

## 1. Local Development

To start working on your project, run the local development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This command uses Turborepo to start all the applications in your monorepo in development mode. For a standard project, this will start your Next.js web app on `http://localhost:3000`.

Any changes you make to your code in any of the `apps/*` directories will trigger a hot reload, so you can see your changes in the browser instantly.

## 2. Smart Contract Development

If your project includes smart contracts, your workflow will typically involve these steps:

1.  **Write Contracts**: Add or modify your Solidity contracts in `apps/hardhat/contracts`.
2.  **Compile**: Run `pnpm contracts:compile` to compile your contracts and generate TypeScript types.
3.  **Test**: Write and run tests for your contracts using `pnpm contracts:test`.
4.  **Deploy**: Deploy your contracts to a local network or a testnet like Celo Sepolia using the `pnpm contracts:deploy:celo-sepolia` scripts.

## 3. Building for Production

When you're ready to build your application for production, you can use the build command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command, powered by Turborepo, will create an optimized production build for all the applications in your monorepo. The output will be placed in the `dist` directory for each app (e.g., `apps/web/dist`).

## 4. Debugging

- **Frontend Debugging**: You can use your browser's developer tools to debug the Next.js application, just like any other web app.
- **Smart Contract Debugging**: Hardhat provides excellent debugging tools, including `console.log` support in your Solidity contracts, which will print logs to the terminal when you run your tests.

## 5. Adding Dependencies

To add a new dependency to a specific app or package, use the PNPM `--filter` flag:

```bash
# Add a dependency to the web app
pnpm add <package-name> --filter web

# Add a dependency to the hardhat app
pnpm add <package-name> --filter hardhat
```

This ensures that the dependency is added to the correct `package.json` file within your monorepo.
