<h2> Inspiration 🔥</h2>
<p>

The original [celo composer](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer)  served as an inspiration for this project. I created this fork as an improvement to the original project because I noticed that the team was responding to PR and issue reports more slowly than I had anticipated. This is where you and I, as a community member, can help 😎.
</p>

<p>
Making contributions to the original branch makes more sense, but given the response friction, I would prefer to work on this branch with community assistance while staying in contact with the Celo Devrel team to ensure that this project is in line with the original project's mission, which is to enable anyone to quickly build, deploy, and iterate on decentralized applications using Celo.

<h2> Proposal 🔖</h2> 

 - **Components 📦** (Add more components)
	 - Faucet (Get test tokens into your wallet on Alfajeros)
	 - Contract   (Read and write to any contract with writing a sigle line of code)
	 - Events (List smart contract events)
	 - Ramp (Buy Celo or cUSD with Fiat to your Dapp or Wallet)
- **Build Tutorial 🛠**
	- ERC20 Token (Launch your token & distribute it)
	- NFT Forest (Mint trees in a forest as NFT for preservation)
	- Swap DEX (Swap between Celo & cUSD using Oracle to determine price)
	-  Sign in with Celo (Trustless on chain login using your Celo wallet signature)
- **Advance Topics ⛓** (Build a Dapp to cover the following topics)
	- Smart contract proxy / Delegate call
	- Upgradable contract
	- Openzeppelin Defender
	- Graph Protocol
- **Challenge 🧩**
	- Solidity exploit series (Gamefiy this section, where learners fix smart contract issue with tips given)
	- Assignments (In view)
- **More Yarn Commands**
- **More React Hooks**
- **Tools & Resources Help/Docs**
	- Hardhat
	- Solidity
	- Nextjs
- **Comprehensive Documentation using Gitbook 📚**
- **Youtube Videos 🎥**
- **Talks 🎙**


<h2> Bias 🙈</h2> 
Solidity, Node.js, and React are technologies that I have experience with, so they will be a large part of the earlier work. I would appreciate any contributions that would help flutter or React Native develop and support more mobile applications.
