<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Celo Composer allows you to quickly build, deploy, and iterate on decentralized applications using Celo. It provides a number of frameworks, templates, deployment and component support, and Celo specific functionality to help you get started with your next dApp. 

It is the perfect lightweight starter-kit for any hackathon and for quickly testing out integrations and deployments on Celo.

## Built With

Celo Composer is built on Celo to make it simple to build dApps using a variety of front-end frameworks, and libraries.

- [Celo](https://celo.org/)
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [viem](https://viem.sh/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Prerequisites

- Node (v20 or higher)
- Git (v2.38 or higher)

## How to use Celo Composer

The easiest way to start with Celo Composer is using `@celo/celo-composer`. This CLI tool lets you quickly start building dApps on Celo, including several templates. To get started, just run the following command, and follow the steps:

- Step 1

```bash
npx @celo/celo-composer@latest create
```

- Step 2: Provide the Project Name: You will be prompted to enter the name of your project.

```text
What is your project name: 
```

- Step 3: Choose to Use Hardhat: You will be asked if you want to use Hardhat. Select Yes or No.

```text
Do you want to use Hardhat? (Y/n)
```

- Step 4: Choose to Use a Template: You will be asked if you want to use a template. Select `Yes` or `No`.

```text
Do you want to use a template?
```

- Step 5: Select a Template: If you chose to use a template, you will be prompted to select a template from the list provided.

```text
- Minipay
- Valora
```

- Step 6: Provide the Project Owner's Name: You will be asked to enter the project owner's name.

```text
Project Owner name:
```

- Step 7: Wait for Project Creation: The CLI will now create the project based on your inputs. This may take a few minutes.

- Step 8: Follow the instructions to start the project. The same will be displayed on the console after the project is created.

```text
ðŸš€ Your starter project has been successfully created!
```

## Install Dependencies


Once your custom dApp has been created, just install dependencies, either with yarn:

```bash
   yarn
```

If you prefer npm, you can run:

```bash
   npm install
```

## Deploy a Smart Contract

Find the detailed instructions on how to run your smart contract in [packages/hardhat/README.md](./packages/hardhat/README.md).

For quick development follow these three steps:

1. Change `packages/hardhat/env.template` to `packages/hardhat/env` and add your `PRIVATE_KEY` into the `.env` file.
2. Make sure your wallet is funded when deploying to testnet or mainnet. You can get test tokens for deploying it on Alfajores from the [Celo Faucet](https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores).
3. Run the following commands from the `packages/hardhat` folder to deploy your smart contract to the Celo Testnet Alfajores:

```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts --network alfajores
```

## Deploy your Dapp Locally

Find the detailed instructions on how to run your frontend in the [`react-dapp` README.md](./packages/react-app/README.md).

Before you start the project, please follow these steps:

1. Rename the file:
   packages/react-app/.env.template
   to
   packages/react-app/.env

2. Open the newly renamed .env file and add your WalletConnect Cloud Project ID from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/)

Once you've done that, you're all set to start your project!

Run the following commands from the `packages/react-app` folder to start the project:

```bash
   yarn dev
```

If you prefer npm, you can run:

```bash
   npm run dev
```

Thank you for using Celo Composer! If you have any questions or need further assistance, please refer to the README or reach out to our team.

**_ðŸ”¥Voila, you have a dApp ready to go. Start building your dApp on Celo._**


## Add UI Components

To keep the Celo Composer as lightwieght as possible we didn't add any components but rather a guide on how to add the components you need yourself with a very simple to use components library. To learn how to add UI components using [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) in this project, refer to the [UI Components Guide](./docs/UI_COMPONENTS.md).

## Deploy with Vercel

The Celo Composer is a great tool for hackathons and fast deployments. We created a guide for you, using the Vercel CLI to create a live deployment in minutes. For detailed instructions on deploying the Next.js app using Vercel CLI, refer to the [Deployment Guide](./docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).
